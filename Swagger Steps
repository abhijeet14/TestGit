Question:  what is swagger?
Answer:    ummm…one min please…I heard somewhere…no clue..

If you have same answer as I had on Friday… so let’s do it for swagger..

Swagger UI is part of the Swagger project. The Swagger project allows you to produce, visualize and consume your OWN Restful services. 
Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate beautiful documentation and sandbox from a Swagger-compliant API.
As Swagger is a language-agnostic specification, with its declarative resource specification, 
clients can easily understand and consume services without any prior knowledge of server implementation or access to the server code.

I have created REST application “Spring-SwaggerUI”, which is placed in  “R:\Users\Abhijeet Jain”. It’s a maven project so you can import in your workplace. (ref snap-1)

Steps to plug swagger in our project:

1] add dependency “swagger-springmvc” in pom (ref snap-swagger-pom).
2] download swagger UI from  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui and place it in resource folder.
3] Define “swagger.properties” file with “documentation.services.version” and “documentation.services.basePath” as mentioned in project.
4] add configuration in your servlet-context.xml (snap-4)

In EmployeeRestController.java, add swagger annotation   like @api, @apioperation. As swagger has many annotation for many purpose. 
Example:

@Api(basePath = "/rest", value = "employeesInfo", description = "employeesInfo")

&

@ApiOperation(value = "Get Employee By ID", notes = "Get Employee By ID")      
    @ApiError(code = 400, reason = "Invalid ID supplied")

It’s ready…only you have to run maven command- mvn install…
Deploy your generated snapshot to any web server.

Now…open URL:  http://localhost:8080/Spring-SwaggerUI/swagger-ui/index.html .. It will look like (snap-2).
Enter  http://localhost:8080/Spring-SwaggerUI/api-docs in search box. It will display your all operation.

You can expend operation and check with description and schema, even you can test it. ( we can add Oath in our project also for two way security) (snap-3)

In Spring you can add separation configuration file with other functionality. It’s a sample application just for presentation.
I have added JAXB (xml representation also) , which I had not cover with this slides.

Please add more inputs for this topics so we can use extensively. If I missed anything then rectify me.

Happy Learning  
